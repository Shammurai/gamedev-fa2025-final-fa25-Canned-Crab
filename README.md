## Game Description

Bottega (Italian for "workshop" or "studio") is a fast-paced task management game set in a Renaissance artist's workshop. You are an aspiring artist who must first prove yourself worthy by completing various household and workshop chores with speed and precision. Each day brings new challenges, and your performance determines whether you'll advance to more prestigious duties or remain stuck doing grunt work.

### Unique Gameplay Features

**Fast-Paced Minigame Collection:** Experience a variety of quick, engaging minigames that simulate real apprentice tasks, from organizing supplies to preparing artistic materials.

**Dynamic Progression System:** Your performance directly impacts your career trajectory. Complete tasks efficiently to unlock more advanced responsibilities and move closer to becoming a true artist.

**Spur-of-the-Moment Decision Making:** React quickly to changing priorities and unexpected demands from your master. Time management is crucial.

**Authentic Renaissance Setting:** Immerse yourself in the world of Renaissance art through a unique 2D ink sketch visual style that brings the era to life.

### What Makes This Game Different?

Unlike traditional time management games, Bottega ties your day-to-day performance directly to long-term career progression. Your apprenticeship can be terminated for poor performance, or you can rise through the ranks to complete your training and become a master artist yourself. The game combines the urgency of mini-game collections with meaningful progression stakes.

### Goal

Your ultimate goal is to complete your apprenticeship by achieving an advanced win on the highest difficulty of Stage 3 (Painting). Along the way, you must avoid being fired by preventing two consecutive failed days. Prove your worth, climb the ladder from menial tasks to actual artistic work, and earn your place as a Renaissance artist.

## Game Loop

1. **Receive Task:** Your master assigns you a task based on your current stage and previous performance
2. **Complete Task Quickly:** Race against the clock to finish the task efficiently
3. **Repeat Until Day End:** Continue completing tasks throughout the workday
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Your score determines tomorrow's responsibilities and potential stage advancement

## Progression System

### Three Stages of Mastery

**Stage 1 - Handling Supplies, Cleaning, Organizing**
The grunt work every apprentice must start with. Prove you can maintain a clean, organized workshop.

**Stage 2 - Preparing Canvases, Paints, Brushes**
Graduate to preparing the actual materials your master uses for their art. Handle delicate supplies with care.

**Stage 3 - Painting**
The pinnacle of apprenticeship. You're finally trusted to work on actual artwork under your master's guidance.

### Win/Fail Conditions
